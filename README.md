# 🤖 AutoStream AI Agent

Hi there! This is the AI Agent I built for the ServiceHive ML Internship assignment. It's designed to act as a first-line support and lead generation bot for "AutoStream," a fictional video editing SaaS.

The bot can answer questions about pricing and features using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and detecting when a user is ready to buy—automatically switching gears to collect their lead information.
